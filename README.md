## 🧠 Description

This repository contains **Rust-powered tools for reverse engineering APKs and URL structures**, designed for **ethical security research, red-team exercises, and protocol analysis**.  

Key focus areas:

- 🔹 **APK reverse engineering** – Analyze package structures, extract metadata, and study application behavior.  
- 🔹 **URL reverse analysis** – Understand URL routing, API calls, and payload structures.  
- 🔹 **Ethical offensive research** – All work is intended for **legal, professional, and research purposes only**.  
- 🔹 **Rust-powered performance** – Fast, reliable, and memory-safe tooling designed for modern reverse-engineering workflows.  

This repository is built to support **security research labs, educational projects, and red-team simulations**, with a focus on **understanding systems, not exploiting them**.
